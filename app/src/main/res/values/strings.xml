        This is a really basic heart beat monitor to give you results really fast.

        \n\nThere are two distinct pulses that come close together. If you feel both just
        press the button once. (Otherwise the estimate will flail around like a shirt caught in a
        car door.)

        \n\nMeasuring yourself and taping the screen is quite hard (it can be done). I suggest
        getting a friend to help you. - You can hold the device, and they can feel your pulse and
        tap the button with the other hand.
        \nAlternatively, my fiance came up with a really easy way to do it yourself. Use one hand to
        press the button and the other to measure your pulse on your neck. It\'s really easy!

        \n\nMost measurements are variations of BMP (Beats Per Minute).

        \n\nIMPORTANT
        \nNothing in this app should be taken as medical advice. If you
        need medical advice or have any medical questions, please see your doctor.</string>
